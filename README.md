## Overview

The Expense Tracker is a small yet powerful application designed to help users keep track of their expenses effortlessly. Leveraging a comprehensive tech stack, this project demonstrates the integration of modern web technologies to provide a seamless and responsive user experience. Users can easily log their expenses and keep track of their spending through a clean and intuitive interface.

This project is divided into two main parts:
- **Frontend**: Built with React and styled with TailwindCSS, the frontend offers a dynamic and responsive user interface.
- **Backend**: Powered by Bun and TypeScript, the backend uses Hono and tRPC for routing and API handling, with PostgreSQL as the database hosted externally on Neon.

**Note:** This is not a product, but a simple project aimed at learning and demonstrating the use of a comprehensive tech stack.

## Features

- **Authentication**: Secure login and registration using Kinde.
- **Expense Management**: Add, view, and delete expenses with ease.
- **Profile Management**: View and manage user profile details.
- **Data Handling**: Robust backend with Drizzle ORM and PostgreSQL.
- **Form Validation**: Client-side validation with Zod for a smoother user experience.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Bun

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/MuhdHanish/expense_tracker.git
   cd expense_tracker
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   bun install
   ```

3. Set up the environment variables:
   ```sh
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   Fill in the required environment variables in the `.env` file.

## Running the Application

### Script Commands

- **db-studio**: This command opens the database studio for managing the database. It uses `bunx drizzle-kit studio` to launch the database studio provided by Drizzle.

- **migrate**: This command generates migrations using `bun drizzle-kit generate` and then applies those migrations to the database using `bun migrate.ts`. It's used for managing database schema changes and data migrations.

- **start:server**: This command starts the backend server. It runs the entry file `server/index.ts` using `bun`.

- **dev:server**: This command starts the backend server in development mode with watch mode enabled. It monitors changes to files in the `server` directory and restarts the server automatically when changes are detected.

- **dev:client**: This command starts the frontend development server. It changes directory to the `client` directory and then runs `bun run dev` to start the frontend server.

- **build:client**: This command builds the frontend for production. It changes directory to the `client` directory and then runs `bun run build` to generate production-ready assets.

- **dev**: This command runs both the backend and frontend servers concurrently in development mode. It uses `concurrently` to execute multiple commands simultaneously. Specifically, it starts the backend server in development mode and then builds and starts the frontend server.

## Routes

### Frontend Routes

- **/**: Home page showing the total expense of the current user.
- **/expenses**: Expense list table with pagination.
- **/create-expense**: Page to create a new expense with form validation.
- **/profile**: Profile page showing the user's profile picture, name, and logout button.

### Backend Routes

All backend routes are prefixed with `/api`.

#### Authentication Routes (`/api/auth`)

- **/profile**: Get user profile details.
- **/login**: User login.
- **/register**: User registration.
- **/logout**: User logout.

#### Expense Routes (`/api/expenses`)

- **/** (GET): Get all expenses.
- **/** (POST): Create a new expense.
- **/:id** (GET): Get an expense by ID.
- **/:id** (DELETE): Delete an expense by ID.
- **/total-spent** (GET): Get the total spent by the user.
